üõ∏ Autoscaling Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runners on Hetzner Cloud 
=====================================================================

A simple alternative to Github's `Recommended autoscaling solutions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/autoscaling-with-self-hosted-runners#recommended-autoscaling-solutions>`_.

:üîç Tip:
   See `Wiki <https://github.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/wiki>`_ for full documentation.

The **github-hetzner-runners** service program starts and monitors queued-up jobs for GitHub Actions workflows.
When a new job is queued up, it creates a new Hetzner Cloud server instance
that provides an ephemeral GitHub Actions runner. Each server instance is automatically
powered off when the job completes, and then powered off servers are
automatically deleted. Both **x64** (*x86*) and **arm64** (*arm*) runners are supported.
See `Features <#-features>`_ and `Limitations <#-limitations>`_ for more details.

:‚ùóWarning:
   This program is provided on "AS IS" basis without warranties or conditions of any kind. See LICENSE.
   Use it at your own risk. Manual monitoring is required to make sure server instances are cleaned up properly
   and costs are kept under control.

Costs depend on the server type, number of jobs, and execution time. For each job, a new server instance is created
to avoid any cleanup. Server instances are not shared between jobs.

:‚úã Note:
   Currently, Hetzner Cloud server instances are billed on an hourly basis. So a job that takes 1 minute will be billed
   the same way as for a job that takes 59 minutes. Therefore, unless server reuse is enabled using `server recycling <https://github.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/wiki/Recycling-Powered%E2%80%90Off-Servers>`_, 
   the minimal cost for any job is the cost of the server for one hour plus the cost of one public IPv4 address. 
   If server recycling is used, the amortized cost could be close to per-minute billing depending on server utilization.

üîß Limitations
==============

**Group runners are not supported**
  ‚úé However, you can run individual services for each repository using different Hetzner Cloud projects.

**A unique Hetzner Cloud project must be used for each repository**
   ‚úé However, unique projects allow you to easily keep track of runner costs per repository.

================
üíª Prerequisites
================

* Linux OS (tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
* Python >= 3.7
* `Hetzner Cloud <https://www.hetzner.com/cloud>`_ account
* GitHub API classic token with privileges to manage self-hosted runners

:‚ùóWarning:
   You must use a classic token. Fine-grained tokens are not supported.

===========================
üéØ Getting Started Tutorial
===========================

:‚úÖ Launch your first self-hosted runner in:
   5 minutes

This tutorial will guide you on how to use the **github-hetzner-runners** program to provide autoscaling GitHub Actions runners
for a GitHub repository and a Hetzner Cloud project that you'll create.

-----------------------------------
Installing TestFlows Github Runners
-----------------------------------

‚ù∂ Before we get started, you will need to install **testflows.github.hetzner.runners** Python package. See the `Installation <https://github.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/wiki/Installation>`_ section for more details.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip3 install testflows.github.hetzner.runners

‚ù∑ Check that the **github-hetzner-runners** utility was installed correctly by executing the **github-hetzner-runners -v** command.

.. code-block:: bash

   github-hetzner-runners -v

::

   1.3.230731.1173142

:‚úã Note:
   The **github-hetzner-runners** utility is installed in to the *~/.local/bin/* folder. Please make sure that this folder
   is part of the **PATH**.

   .. code-block:: bash

      which github-hetzner-runners

   ::

      ~/.local/bin/github-hetzner-runners

   If your **PATH** is missing this folder, on Ubuntu, you can modify your *~/.profile* and add the following section:

   :~/.profile:
      .. code-block:: bash

         # set PATH so it includes the user's private bin if it exists
         if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
             PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
         fi

In order to launch the **github-hetzner-runners** program, we'll need to specify the GitHub repository as well as GitHub and
Hetzner Cloud tokens. So, let's create these.

------------------------------------------------------------
Creating a GitHub Repository With Actions Workflow and Token
------------------------------------------------------------

Before using the **github-hetzner-runners**, you need a GitHub repository with a GitHub Actions workflow set up.

‚ù∂ First, create a GitHub repository named **demo-testflows-github-hetzner-runners** and note the repository name.

The repository name will have the following format:

::

   <username>/demo-testflows-github-hetzner-runners

For me, my GitHub repository is:

::

   vzakaznikov/demo-testflows-github-hetzner-runners

‚ù∑ Now, create an example GitHub Actions workflow as described in the `Quickstart for GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart>`_ article.
Note that we need to modify the example YAML configuration and specify that our job will run on a runner with the **self-hosted** and the **type-cpx21**
labels.

.. code-block:: yaml

     Explore-GitHub-Actions:
       runs-on: [self-hosted, type-cpx21]

So, the complete *demo.yml* that uses a self-hosted runner is as follows:

:demo.yml:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      name: GitHub Actions Demo
      run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions üöÄ
      on: [push]
      jobs:
        Explore-GitHub-Actions:
          runs-on: [self-hosted, type-cpx21]
          steps:
            - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
            - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
            - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
            - name: Check out repository code
              uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
            - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
            - name: List files in the repository
              run: |
                ls ${{ github.workspace }}
            - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."


‚ù∏ Finally, you will need to create a GitHub API token with the **workflow** privileges. Make sure to save the token!

:‚ùóWarning:
   You must use a classic token. Fine-grained tokens are not supported.
   

For me, my *demo* GitHub token is:

::

   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

You should now have your GitHub repository ready.

See these steps in action:

   :align: center
   :width: 790px
   :alt: Creating a GitHub Repository and Token

------------------------------------------
Creating a Hetzner Cloud Project and Token
------------------------------------------

Next, you will need to create a Hetzner Cloud project and an API token that we can use to create and manage Hetzner Cloud server instances.

‚ù∂ Create a new Hetzner Cloud project **Demo GitHub Runners**.

‚ù∑ Now, create an API token and save it.

For me, the Hetzner Cloud token for my *Demo GitHub Runners* project is:

::

   5Up04IHuY8mC7l0JxKwh3Aps4ghGIyL0NJ9rGlhyAmmkddzuRreR1YstTSTFCG0N

You should now have your Hetzner Cloud project ready.

See these steps in action:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/master/docs/images/hetzner_create_project_and_token.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 790px
   :alt: Creating a GitHub Repository and Token

------------------------
Creating a Cloud Service
------------------------

With the GitHub repository and GitHub and Hetzner Cloud tokens in hand, we can deploy the **github-hetzner-runners** service
to the Hetzner Cloud instance. This way, the service is not running on your local machine.

During the deployment, we'll create a **github-hetzner-runners** instance in your Hetzner Cloud project on which the service will be running.
See the `Running as a Cloud Service <https://github.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/wiki/Running-as-a-Cloud-Service>`_ section for details.

‚ù∂ To deploy the service run the **github-hetzner-runners cloud deploy** command and specify your
GitHub repository, GitHub, and Hetzner Cloud tokens using
**GITHUB_REPOSITORY**, **GITHUB_TOKEN**, and **HETZNER_TOKEN** environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

   export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=
   export HETZNER_TOKEN=
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=
   github-hetzner-runners cloud deploy

You should now have the cloud service up and running.

See these steps in action:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/master/docs/images/cloud_deploy.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 625px
   :alt: Deploying Cloud Service

----------------------------------------------
Waiting for the GitHub Actions Job to Complete
----------------------------------------------

‚ù∂ The **github-hetzner-runners** cloud service is now running. So, now you can just sit back and wait until **github-hetzner-runners**
spins up a new runner to complete any queued-up GitHub Actions jobs in your GitHub repository.

See this step in action:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/master/docs/images/github_job_completed.gif
   :align: center
   :width: 790px
   :alt: Waiting For the GitHub Actions Job to Complete

As you can see, our job was executed and completed using our own self-hosted runner!

:‚úã Note:

   If you run into any issues, you can check the cloud service log using the
   **github-hetzner-runners cloud log -f** command. For other cloud service commands, see the `Running as a Cloud Service <https://github.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/wiki/Running-as-a-Cloud-Service>`_ section.

   .. code-block:: bash

      github-hetzner-runners cloud log -f

================================
üì° Embedded Monitoring Dashboard
================================

The service supports an embedded monitoring dashboard that provides real-time visibility into your GitHub Actions runners. The dashboard includes:

* Gauges for heartbeat, cost (‚Ç¨/h), total servers, total runners, queued jobs, running jobs, and scale-up errors
* System information and configuration details
* Hourly cost tracking
* Server status monitoring (running, off, initializing, ready, busy)
* Job status tracking (queued and running jobs)
* Runner status monitoring (online/offline and busy/idle states)
* Scale-up error tracking
* Log messages (last 100 lines) with full log download capability

Below is a live demonstration of the `embedded monitoring dashboard <https://github.com/testflows/TestFlows-GitHub-Hetzner-Runners/wiki/Embedded-Monitoring-Dashboard>`_ in action, monitoring runners for the `altinity/clickhouse-regression <https://github.com/altinity/clickhouse-regression>`_ project:
